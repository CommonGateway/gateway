## Documentation

We host technical documentation on [Read the Doc's](https://readthedocs.org/) and general user information on GitHub pages, to make the documentation compatible with GitHub we document in markdown (instead of reStructuredText). Documentation is part of the project and contained within the `/docs` folder.
