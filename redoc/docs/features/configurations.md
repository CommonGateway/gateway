This `configurations` tab is to export your configuration. Clicking the export configurations button will automatically download an `export.yaml` file with your Gateway configuration.

This download option for exporting a file containing a data set, for GDPR reasons, is preferable created through the Conductor Gateway (for logging in to the GDPR registry).

All the collection endpoints support returning downloadable files, besides JSON objects. Select the 'accept' head to the preferred file format. We currently support `text/csv`,`application/ms-excel`,`application/pdf`. You can use the field, extend, and pagination query functionality to influence the result/data set.
